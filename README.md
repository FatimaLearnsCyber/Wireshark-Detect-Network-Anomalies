# Wireshark for Security: Detect Network Anomalies Project

This project was completed as part of Courseraâ€™s guided learning: **Wireshark for Security: Detect Network Anomalies**.

## Tools & Environment
- Wireshark
- Ubuntu Linux (cloud-based environment)

## What I Did
- Captured and filtered real-time network packets.
- Identified and analyzed suspicious patterns such as:
  - Unknown IP traffic
  - Unusual packet sizes and frequencies
  - Potential DDoS-like bursts
- Applied display filters in Wireshark to isolate anomalies:
  - Filtered specific IPs
  - Highlighted abnormal protocol behavior

## Key Learnings
- Enhanced understanding of packet-level inspection
- Improved ability to use Wireshark for security purposes
- Gained skills in identifying attack signatures in network data

## Certification
